# 2DIdealGasInABox
Simulate N particles in a 2D box, bouncing elastically off the walls (and optionally off each other). Then:  watch how their velocity distribution evolves  measure temperature from kinetic energy  measure pressure from momentum transfer on the walls  compare to Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution and the ideal gas law
